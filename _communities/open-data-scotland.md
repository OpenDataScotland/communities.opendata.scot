Open Data Scotland is a 100% volunteer-run, collaborative community promoting open data through open source. We work with public sector bodies, private companies, and individuals to make data more accessible and usable for everyone.


We aim to help people
- locate Open Data better
- understand what we have in Scotland
- and promote projects which use these Open Data


All of this is to help the public understand what Open Data is available in Scotland.

## The problem we’re trying to solve

**Users of open data don’t know where to find data **
- Sources are disparate and decentralised
- Very reliant on knowing who to ask and where to look
- High barrier to access for the occasional user


**There have been attempts to collate sources before**
- Well intentioned, but one-off events
- Huge effort to maintain
- Sources become aged and irrelevant


**Some people don’t recognise the term “open data”**


**We wanted to build a community of like-minded people across Scotland and further!**
