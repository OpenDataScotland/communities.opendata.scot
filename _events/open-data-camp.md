Open Data Camp is a two-day, weekend event, entirely devoted to Open Data. It loosely follows the [Unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format:

- There is an unconference  
- There is story-telling  
- There is the making of stuff  
- There is networking  
- There is cake  

Open Data Camp has been inspired by other unconferences like those shown here. It had its own distinctive style, but we borrowed liberally from lots of others who have beaten a path ahead of us.
