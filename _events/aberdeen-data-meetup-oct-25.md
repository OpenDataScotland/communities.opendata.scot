**"Make your data project sparkle with Wikidata!" - Ian Watt**

Wikidata is the world’s largest open knowledge graph, bringing together facts about people, places, culture, and science in a way that anyone can query and reuse. Maintained by a global community and freely available under the public domain dedication (CC0), it has become an essential backbone for open data projects, research, and digital innovation.

In this interactive session you’ll discover what Wikidata is, why its unique licensing model makes it so powerful, and how to unlock its potential using SPARQL - the query language for linked data. After a short introduction, we’ll roll up our sleeves for a code-along where you’ll write your own queries to explore topics such as creating a timeline of Scottish Writers to plotting Scottish football stadiums on a map.

Whether you’re a data enthusiast, developer, researcher, or simply curious, this hands-on workshop will give you the tools and inspiration to connect your own projects to the vast universe of Wikidata. And if you are a Python coder we will look at how to use that to programmatically retrieve data from WD - and more that you can explore.

***Speaker Bio***

**Ian Watt** is a co-founder and Trustee of the charity *Code The City* (SC053447), and a long-standing advocate for open knowledge and open data. In 2010, while at Aberdeen City Council, he led the authority to become the first public body in Scotland to publish open data. He went on to co-author the Scottish Government’s *Open Data Strategy* (2015) and later established the annual Scottish Open Data Unconference in 2020.

Ian’s contributions have been widely recognised. He won two national awards in 2013: *SOCITM Member of the Year,* and the *Digital Leaders 50 UK Local Government Award,* and has since been shortlisted for honours from Wikimedia UK (2019, 2020) and the Open UK Awards (2021). In 2023, he was made a Burgess of Guild of the City and Royal Burgh of Aberdeen, and in 2025 he received the *Order of the Scottish Samurai*.

Alongside his governance roles, including five years as a non-executive director of Democracy Club, Ian is an active trainer for Wikimedia UK and runs multiple Aberdeen-based meetups, including a monthly Wiki Meetup. He has written extensively about open data, including a paper for the David Hume Institute, and gained an MSc in Data Science following his retirement from the public sector. He is also a Fellow of the RSA and of the Institute of Leadership.
